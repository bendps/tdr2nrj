# Get energetics from TDR data
This repository contains all the annotated R scripts used in the JEB paper
"Innovative Use of Depth Data to Estimate Energy Intake and Expenditure in Adélie Penguins"
https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.249201
To access logger data, please go to https://doi.org/10.57745/IT6ITA

All scripts are ordered to follow results presented in the paper :
- 1.1 to 1.3 correspond to "Energy expenditure estimation" section of the results
- 2.1 to 2.4 correspond to "Random forest analysis for detecting feeding activity" section
- 2.5 corresponds to "Feeding activity estimation and comparison with historical proxies"
- 3 corresponds to at-sea energetics of Adélie penguins.
